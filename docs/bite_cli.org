#+TITLE: Local Bite Solver
#+AUTHOR: Russell Helmstedter
#+DATE: <2022-02-01>

* Original Work Flow
This is an outline for a project that helps people solve PyBites on the command line. Currently the workflow is annoying (at best). Consider the following:

1. Navigate to the bite page on the website and 
2. click the drop down button to solve locally.
3. Download the zip file for that bite.
4. Navigate to the directory where the bite was downloaded.
5. Unzip the new directory into a folder named by the bite number: `../pybites/<bite number>`
6. Solve the bite.
7. Go through the steps to push up to GitHub:
  + `git add .`
  - `git commit -m 'solved <bite number>'`
  - `git push`
8. Navigate back to website.
9. Download the code from GitHub.
10. Submit bite.

* Wishlist

What I would like to have happen:
    1. run `eatlocal -d <bite number> && eatlocal -e <bite number>` (Package downloads and extracts a bite into PyBites directory.)
    2. Solve bite
    3. run `eatlocal -s <bite number>` (Submit bite and open web browser to the corresponding bite page.)

* Current Work Flow
    I have a working version of eatlocal and the [[Wishlist][wishlist]] has been completely fulfilled. It can extract a zipped file that is already in the local repo. It can now submit a bite by first pushing it to GitHub and opening your default web browser to the corresponding bite page. I still need to down load the code from GitHub and then submit manually. It can download and extract a bite using selenium in headless mode. It works in windows powershell and on macOS. It still needs to be tested on Linux.

    After talking with Bob, we decided that the download flag should only download and not include the extract function. This adds a little extra typing, but is more transparent about what is happening.

* Enhancements
** TODO Add a read flag to read the instructions of the bite in the terminal.
   
* Known Issues
  + Erik mentioned that he needed to set up a pasword since he had authenticated pybites using github. Need to add this caveat to the readme. 
  + Once Erik's pull requests are merged, I need to restructure the read me. Perhaps have a quickstart documentation directly in the readme and then the full help documentation linked?
  + Need tests that cover submiting a bite
